# Laser-Painting
Laser painting device for Raspberry Pi Pico

This is a simple project built on Raspberry Pi Pico. It will have a laser mounted on a servo which is itself mounted on another servo. The two servos are initially controlled with two potentiometers. The idea is to capture servo position information to save the laser line strokes needed to write letters, or any other thing you want. Then the user will be able to enter a string, and the device will light paint it on the wall by replicating the motion captured for each letter. The light painting will be captured by a camera using long exposures.
